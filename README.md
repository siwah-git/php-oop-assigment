PHP OOP

This project showcases the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP. The project is structured to be clean, modular, and easy to understand, with each class residing in its own file.
Structure

    index.php: The main entry point that runs the application logic.

    classes/: Contains all PHP class definitions, organized into sub-folders based on their functionality.

    data/: A folder for additional data files, such as CSV or log files.

How to Run ? 

    Ensure you have PHP version 8 or later installed.

    Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

    Run the application using the built-in PHP development server:

    php -S localhost:8000

    Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8000 to see the results.

    Alternatively, you can run it directly from the command line:

    php index.php

The output will be displayed directly in your terminal.
