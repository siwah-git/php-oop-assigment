# PHP OOP Project

This project showcases fundamental principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in PHP. It is structured to be clean, modular, and easy to understand, with each class residing in its own file.

## Project Structure

* **`index.php`**: The main entry point that runs the application logic.
* **`classes/`**: Contains all PHP class definitions, organized into sub-folders based on their function.
* **`data/`**: A folder for any supplementary data files, such as CSV or log files.

## How to Run

1.  **Ensure you have PHP 8 or a newer version installed.**
2.  **Open your terminal** and navigate to the project directory.
3.  **Run the application** using the built-in PHP development server:

    
    php -S localhost:8000


4.  Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` to see the output.
5.  Alternatively, you can run it directly from the command line:

    
    php index.php
   

The result will be displayed directly in your terminal.
